/// An asynchronous reader-writer lock.
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any point in time. The
/// write portion of this lock typically allows modification of the underlying data (exclusive
/// access) and the read portion of this lock typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// The acquisition order of this lock is not guaranteed and depending on the runtime's
/// implementation and preference of any used polling combinators. This implementation will
/// allow the first polled task to acquire the lock after the lock is released.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() {
/// # use pinned::RwLock;
/// let lock = RwLock::new(5);
///
/// // many reader locks can be held at once
/// {
///     let r1 = lock.read().await;
///     let r2 = lock.read().await;
///     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
/// } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
/// // only one write lock may be held, however
/// {
///     let mut w = lock.write().await;
///     *w += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
/// } // write lock is dropped here
/// # }
